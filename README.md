# Reactive Transport 1D

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to model the infiltration of ionic fluids into rocks by coupling the speciation calculation, reactivity with minerals in the infiltrated rock and rock mechanics to study the evolution of permeability and to compare with traditional models without complex fluids.
